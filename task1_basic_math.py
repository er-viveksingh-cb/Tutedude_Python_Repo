Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction

#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
num1=float(input("Enter Number1:"))
num2=float(input("Enter Number2:"))

#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
print("Number 1 enterd by user is:",num1)
print("Number 2 enterd by user is:",num2)

#Addition 
print("Addition of the two numbers is",(num1+num2))

#Subtraction
print("Subtraction of the two numbers is",(num1-num2))

#Multiplication
print("Multiplication of the two numbers is",(num1*num2))

#Division
print("Division of the two numbers is",(num1/num2))
